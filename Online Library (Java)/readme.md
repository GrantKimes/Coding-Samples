Online Client-Server Library (Java)
=================================
This implements a simple text based client and server that allows a user to perform simple operations like search, checkout, and return books.
All data about users and the books they have checked out are on the server side, associated with their account.
This networking design from scratch required a message protocol between client and server to be created, and improved my understanding of socket level networking.
