Dynamic Programming Subset Problem
=================================
Given an array of numbers and a desired number, a subset is found that adds to that number, if it exists.
The naive brute force approach for this problem results in inefficient execution time for non-trivial input sets.
Memoized dynamic programming allows for each value to be evaluated individually, and added to the result set if it works.
