Musician Database Design (Oracle SQL, Java)
==========================================
This project started with the basic levels of database design, from conceptual to logical to physical. 
An entity relationship (ER) diagram was created to model the design. 
Multiple stages of normalization were applied to remove functional dependencies and result in normalized form.
Then the schema was implemented, checking that the required queries would be possible with this design. 
A more descriptive writeup is available in the Word document.
